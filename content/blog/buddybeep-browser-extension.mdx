# Revolutionize Your Web Experience with Our AI-Powered Browser Extension

Well, now you can! We're excited to introduce our new browser extension that's set to change the way you browse the web.

## Capture Content with Ease

Our extension brings the power of content capture right to your browser, similar to the popular Evernote Web Clipper. With just a click, you can save entire web pages, articles, or selected portions of content. This feature is perfect for researchers, students, or anyone who wants to save important information for later reference.

Imagine being able to grasp the key points of a long article in seconds! This feature is a game-changer for busy professionals who need to stay informed but don't have the time to read every word.

## Ask Questions, Get Answers

Here's where our extension really shines. Not only can you capture and summarize content, but you can also ask questions about it using our integrated AI. Wondering about a specific detail in an article? Need clarification on a complex topic? Just ask! Our AI will analyze the captured content and provide you with accurate, context-aware answers.
