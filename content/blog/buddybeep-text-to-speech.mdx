# Introducing Text-to-Speech: A New Way to Engage with Your Notes

We're excited to announce a powerful new feature for iTracksy: Text-to-Speech (TTS)! This addition brings a new dimension to how you interact with your notes, making them more accessible and versatile than ever before. Whether you're reviewing your own notes or exploring public content, TTS is now at your fingertips.

## What's New?

With our latest update, you can now have your notes read aloud to you, both on the edit page and on public note pages. This feature is designed to enhance your note-taking and reviewing experience, offering a hands-free way to absorb information.
