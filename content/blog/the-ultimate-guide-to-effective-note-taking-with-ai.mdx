## Why Does Note-taking AI Matter?

### Note-taking in short

We have all surely learned how to [note-take](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/effective-note-taking-in-class/) when still in school. As students, we are even encouraged to do so because it helps achieve higher grades as well as consume knowledge easier and faster.

In short, note-taking is a process in which information is captured and recorded in a personalized way for future reference. Through that, memory retention is enhanced and learning outcomes are broadened.

However, note-taking is surely not only for students but also proves to be viable for office workers and researchers. For researchers, the benefits of note-taking are probably the same as students. Meanwhile, for office people, note-taking helps you document events, save knowledge for later use or jot down unexpected ideas whenever you need.

As a result, a new concept and mission of note-taking have arisen in later years and it is called second brain, first featured in the book with the same name by Tiago Forte. Now, let's go through it!

### Second Brain

Basically, Tiago Forte introduces the concept '[second brain](https://books.google.com.vn/books/about/Building_a_Second_Brain.html?id=G5BOEAAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y)' as a place where you save everything essential into a digital note space. The reasons for this action are to free your brain memory, let you find valuable things in a blink, write down ideas, etc.

This concept has proven to be really effective and being adopted by many people worldwide. So, what led to the birth of second brain?

The keyword here is digital. In the past, you can only jot down in physical note books, papers,... and carrying them all the time is not so recommended. But now, with digital devices and applications, you can access the notes whenever you want with just some touches on the screen. Moreover, being able to share your notes (knowledge, important information) with colleagues, friends has become easier than ever.

Yes, when combined with AI, this has paved the way for AI note-taker to become popular for students, office employees, researchers, etc.

So, coming up next is how AI note application raises the noting process to the next level.

## Change The Game With An AI Notetaker

![A person using an notetaking platform with AI personal assistant](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/notetaker-ai-powered.png-1730099371760?alt=media&token=6671b004-fb57-4415-b75b-0080bdfa6dc3)Usually, people expect AI to improve productivity, quicken the information search, assist in redundant tasks and many more. Coincidentally, this is what an AI personal assistant like iTracksy can help you too.

Okay, then what a notetaking AI can help?

### The basics

Of course, an AI platform for notetaking offers the core elements of a note like writing things down, saving into a personal space for later access, editing notes, categorizing, etc.

These are just the basic things, so there is nothing much to dive deeper here.

### Capturing the whole internet

Instead of having to write manually or select then copy paste, an AI notetaker simplifies things by capturing the whole site for you. However, just capturing is not enough for a thing to be called AI, right?

If you happen to stumble across a long article or paper (10,000 words, maybe). The AI notetaking app automatically extracts and summarizes all the key points that you will need.

Besides, instead of having to watch a 30 minutes, 1 hour long videos from YouTube, why don't you choose to summarize them all by using a notetaker AI?

For ordinary AI platforms, you can just chat about them and there are no options to save for later reference or use. But, an AI notetaker gives you the personal note space, just save everything there.

Surprisingly, iTracksy can offer you all of the benefits above. Fantastic!

### Enhance noting experience

It is understandable that after noting, you will read it later and even expand it further by incorporating new thoughts, information. That is where an AI personal assistant (note) jumps in.

You can just ask AI on anything or write something and AI will finish the rest for you. Hard to imagine? Let's take an example.

This is the first part: "AI notetaker can help me in writing," and you want to finish the later. Here is what is will look like (this part is totally written and finished by [iTracksy AI](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/itracksy-your-everyday-a/cbibgdcbkoikdkeahemkjkpacmgicaco) note in just a click):

AI notetaker can help me in writing Here's the continuation of the text:

By leveraging AI, you can save time, increase efficiency, and boost your creativity. With AI-powered note-taking, you can:

- Auto-generate summaries of long articles, videos, or papers
- Capture key points and summarise complex information
- Save and organize your notes in a personalized digital space
- Use natural language processing to expand on your notes and ideas
- Even ask your AI assistant to help you write and complete your notes

By harnessing the power of AI, you can take your note-taking to the next level and experience a more streamlined, efficient, and effective way of capturing and processing information.

Now, you see the power! Feeling interested now? Then dive deeper into the criteria to choose an AI personal note platform with us.

## Choosing The Right Note Taking AI

![An AI standing in the center of the Google suite to help with notetaking](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/notetaking-ai-platform-on-browser.avif-1730099429735?alt=media&token=788072bf-0d22-4d30-a96c-6fc744a84f4f)When it comes to criteria, we know that everyone has their own preferences. Some like the interface, others like the functionality while many just want it free. But you can find the most common things to consider right below.

### AI Personal Note Interface

Interface is critical as it lets you know whether the learning curve is steep or not. For a process like noting, speed and simplicity are the keys.

Therefore, it is best to look for a notetaker AI with sleek, easy-to-use design and simple management of your notes. Obviously, a fancy interface might be eye-catching, but when it comes to notetaking AI, then we are not so sure.

### The Functionality Of A Notetaker AI

Less is more. Yes, it applies to this kind of application too. Forget the thought that the more functions, the better.

Because more functions equal steep learning curve, stuffed interface and sometimes bad experience. You might want to define what you need for an AI personal note space first.

Here are our opinions: the core function is obviously noting ability, so you might want to look for an AI notetaker allowing you to expand your notes, help you finish something, directly answer any of your questions with a note.

Moreover, it should help you capture and record things on the internet with ease, in just 1 or 2 clicks. Summarization ability is good too.

The ability to edit notes is also worth noticing as it makes the note personalized while giving options like maybe uploading pictures, creating headings, formatting.

If you have not noticed, then iTracksy has all the things mentioned.

### The Price Of An AI Notetaking App

Ideally, it should be free because notetaking is not a complex work and having to pay for it should be a problem. Imagine paying 4 to 5 USD per month just to take notes in an AI notetaking platform, we would say no immediately.

This thing is also in line with the functions. So, more functions mean more work, more server cost, etc. and ultimately, monthly charge.

### The Accessibility Of A Notetaker AI

Notes must be accessed easily. So, avoid the platforms that require you to go through 100 steps to access your notes.

It is wise to choose a platform that can be accessed with a few clicks like a browser extension or web app.

## Does The [Best AI Note Taking App](https://www.itracksy.com/blog/itracksy-sider.ai) Exist?

![Many hands from different people in different jobs using notetaking ai](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/best-ai-notetaking-app.jpg-1730099478218.jpeg?alt=media&token=bb0cceb2-4361-474a-b0f2-742401873dd7)The answer is probably no. Each AI personal note taking app has strengths and weaknesses. It all comes down to your likings and what you look for in an app like that.

However, we can categorize and list some notable ones for you here to support you with picking the right one.

On your own devices, there are always not apps available by default like Notes on iOS and Notepad on PCs. They are easy-to-use, free but there is no AI included and you will not always like the experience.

For applications, we have Evernote, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), OneNote. They are popular, proven to be effective and have existed for a long time. However, Notion is difficult to master, Evernote is limited in functions, does not have AI and unstable at times while OneNote requires you to buy with a Microsoft 365 subscription.

On web, we have [iTracksy](https://www.itracksy.com/), a web app an browser extension being powered by powerful AI models. It not only offers an AI personal assistant but also a sleek, friendly note space. Additionally, [it is free](https://www.itracksy.com/pricing).
