## The Evolution Of AI Content Generation

![An AI writing assistant is working on a computer](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/ai-writing-assistant-working.jpg-1732252720343.jpeg?alt=media&token=5ca53019-2abb-44d6-8649-a956a00da1ab)The beginning of this so-called AI era started from chatbots, if you remember then ChatGPT captured the world by what the chatbot could do. At first, it was purely text generator AI because you just asked and it answered, simple.

But now, over time, things are evolving at a rapid rate. The AI models do not limit themselves to only chatting and producing boring ai generated text. With the advances in research and prompt engineering, powerful emails, captivating stories, scripts and even SEO articles (not this one) are made by AI.

Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT are ruling the game along with tons other models that are finetuned to adapt to your needs. However, in this blog, we are going to explore things related to AI text writer only. Now, let's see what those AI writing assistants can create.

By the way, if you are looking for something that lets you chat with different models at the same time, [iTracksy](https://www.itracksy.com/) has the three best current ones integrated for you.

## Is AI Content Generation Worth Using?

![A man is working with the help of an AI word generator](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/businessman-writing-ai-content-generation.jpg-1732253207988.jpeg?alt=media&token=7432652b-3e69-4232-a34c-ec0540d8b0b6)The answer is definitely yes. There are reasons why people are going crazy about AI and more are applying in their daily lives. If you do not believe, let us give some examples.

- More than 16 million content on Instagram are tagged as AI generated
- 78% creators believe that AI writing assistants' products will become important
- 65.8% people prefer content made by AI over humans because of perceived higher quality

Mind-blowing, right? However, those numbers still have not fully answered the question in the title "Is AI generated text good enough?". That's why we are gonna go deeper into that and to make it more clear, let's split into different field.

### How Text Generator AI Performs In Education

![AI writing assistant is helping a child in study](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/ai-writing-assistant-in-education.jpg-1732252755634.jpeg?alt=media&token=d2ccaa68-bc80-4ced-86e8-5c43c0775d1d)When it comes to education, AI users can be divided into two types: learners and teachers. We will go through the students first.

In the case of a student, AI can greatly improve their marks and save tons of time depending on how they use. For writing essays, AI text writer has proved to be helpful in improving the students' skills, per multiple scientific research. This is especially true when it comes to students whose mother tongue is not English, confirmed by the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers.

Moreover, translation can now also be done lots quicker with the help of AI language models. Students will surely love this when learning foreign language.

Meanwhile, for teachers, AI tools are capable of providing quick, efficient materials. AI question generator should be able to save time when maybe making a test, but it is wise to double-check as AI writing assistants might sometimes be wrong.

In summary, deep AI text generator has proven itself to be effective in terms of education and it is expected to become better. Maybe one day, students will even learn how to write using an AI content generation tool.

And yes, another sales but true here, iTracksy can satisfy both students and teachers with of course, the highest quality possible. Coming along with a distinctive writing feature, the note system cannot be missed too, check it out!

### AI Writing Assistants In A Work Setting

![An AI content generation tool is working on a desk](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/itracksy-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/ai-writing-assistant-in-work.jpg-1732252770894.jpeg?alt=media&token=5b2c5993-0840-4930-b01c-8effe740cd7b)Well, not all positions require a lot of writing, that is obvious, but communication through emails is still popular, so why spend 30 minutes - 1 hour each day to write emails while you can use AI generated sentences instead? Yes, that is what we are talking here as AI writing assistants can remove many hassle and bring you lots of freedom.

That is the reason 75% knowledge workers apply AI to daily tasks.

For professional writers and marketers, text generator AI is even greater. With it, drafts, replies, social media copies, articles are created with ease and in seconds. Therefore, skip the tedious tasks, focus on other prioritized things and safely adopt an AI text writer to assist you.

However, that does not mean we fully support adopting AI writing assistants in all cases. Important information should still be conveyed by real human beings, a conclusion from professional writers, as AI word generator lacks understanding of concept and authority voices.

Furthermore, a researcher once tried running ads on Google and how do you think the result turns out? Ads created by humans outperform the ones create by AI in every terms.

The lesson here is to be mindful of what you create. If it is important, maybe you can ask an AI content generation tool to make the first draft, but then please edit by yourself. In case you do not know which AI writing assistant you need, give iTracksy a try.

### AI Text Writer When Applied To Research

When we mean research, it is like scientific or study-based research. If you need market research, AI models are also pretty good and convenient to find information. iTracksy again, you know :)

Talking about this, let's use a real research to discuss to have a correct viewpoint.

Basically, researchers and experiments found that using AI research tools greatly reduce the time spent. Yet, the efforts needed stay the same because intensive fact-checking is a must. Why is that so?

70% of citations were found to be incorrect. A high level of similarity was discovered, thus easily leading to plagiarism. In addition to that, if you do not have access to the newest versions of AI models, information is often outdated as it is only updated to a certain point of time.

So, the recommendation here is to use AI as an assistant and the main content should be handled by you. Research is a difficult and complicated process, AI text writer has not reached the level to complete one with a high quality. Also, the same things applies to literature review AI tool.

To end this section, here is an interesting piece of info: AI has fueled the rise of fake research papers on Google Scholar, as reported by Forbes.

In conclusion, AI writing assistants should be embraced as soon as possible in your daily lives. While there are limitations, they still prove to be a good method to boost your productivity. Keep in mind that AI generated text will only become better and better over time.

Okay, now let's come to some prominent AI content generation tools and decide which one fits.
